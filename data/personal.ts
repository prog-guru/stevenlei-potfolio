  about: `I'm a senior FullStack engineer with a deep passion for AI and machine learning, particularly in the realm of large language models and retrieval-augmented generation systems. With years of experience leading engineering teams and architecting scalable solutions, I bring both technical expertise and leadership to every project.

My expertise spans the full software development lifecycle, from designing robust system architectures to implementing elegant user interfaces. I specialize in building AI-powered applications that are both performant and user-friendly, with a particular focus on RAG systems, vector databases, and LLM integration.

As a team lead, I'm committed to fostering collaborative environments where engineers can grow and deliver exceptional results. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code, following best practices, and continuously learning from the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, sharing knowledge through technical writing, and exploring the latest developments in AI and web technologies.`,
